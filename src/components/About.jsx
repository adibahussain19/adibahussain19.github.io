                <p>
                    Hello! Welcome to my page. My name is Adiba Hussain. I am 23 years old, living in New York. 
                    I recently graduated from Barnard College of Columbia University where 
                    I received a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and English. <br />

                    <br />
                    I am interested in working on the user interface side of web development and expanding my back-end skills. 
                    I am proficient in Python, Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript coding languages.
                    I would love for the opportunity to pursue a career in Software Engineering and explore my passion for tech. <br />
                        
                    <br />
                    In my free time, I enjoy cooking and baking for my family and friends as well as
                    exploring new restaurants and places in NYC. 
                </p>
